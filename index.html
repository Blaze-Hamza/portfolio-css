      <h1>Marcus Aurelius</h1>

      <p>
        I am Marcus Aurelius, born in Rome in 121, raised to value virtue above
        all. Adopted by Antoninus Pius, I ruled as emperor from 161 with my
        brother Lucius Verus, then alone through plague and war on the Danube
        frontier. For eighteen years I led armies, not from palaces, but from
        camps—writing private thoughts each night to remind myself: control only
        what is yours, accept the rest, live justly, and do your duty without
        complaint. Illness took me in 180 at fifty-eight. I leave behind an
        empire, a son, and these words: strive to be better today than
        yesterday. That is enough.”
